```

## Getting Started
To install and use requires:
* Python 3
* pip

### Installing
1. Download the git repository to a folder of your choice, /path/to/code/autoMontager

2. Install Python package using pip. Ubuntu: ```pip install /path/to/code/autoMontager```; Windows```python -m pip install /path/to/code/autoMontager```

### Using

* Run the tool from the command line after installing via

```
auto_montage
```

## Features
* Super fast!
* Will output photoshop .jsx scripts which should be run from photoshop
* Will put multiple FOV images into a single montage, after appropriately resizing
## To Use
* Enter movie numbers, movie nominal positions, and movie fovs into an .xlsx (excell) file as in the provided template
* Run the tool from the command line
* Use the GUI to enter the required info and run
* Go to photoshop and run the script generated by the tool

## Wishlist
* Output disjoint montage pieces to same document
* Replace numpy interpolation with OpenCV for visualisations without Photoshop
* Use multiprocessing for even faster montaging.
